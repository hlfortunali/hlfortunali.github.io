## About Me

Hello! I'm **LI HENG**, an embedded software architect with 11 years of experience in embedded system development.

### Technical Journey

My career has been focused on embedded software development, specializing in real-time operating systems, motor control, and complex system architecture. From industrial control systems to satellite attitude control, I've been dedicated to solving challenging technical problems and delivering reliable embedded solutions.

### Core Expertise

**Real-Time Operating Systems**
- Deep experience with RTEMS, FreeRTOS, and ThreadX
- LwIP network stack porting and optimization
- Dynamic software update mechanisms

**Embedded Platforms**
- Cortex-M0/M4/M7 (STM32, NXP RT series)
- TI C2000/C6000 DSP family  
- Xilinx Zynq 7000/MPSoC

**Communication Protocols**
- UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, CANOpen
- TCP/IP, LwIP

**Motor & Control Systems**
- PMSM, BLDC, stepper motor control
- PID control (position, speed, current loops)
- Kalman filter and digital filter design

### Featured Projects

Throughout my career, I've led and participated in several challenging projects:

- **Satellite Attitude Control**: Refactored satellite control system on TI C6747 DSP, reduced code by 16% (~11000 lines)
- **RTEMS Porting**: Ported RTEMS to NXP RT1176 with LwIP, improved control frequency from 1Hz to 5Hz
- **Industrial Control**: Built 7-MCU distributed system using CAN bus and FreeRTOS for 3D printers
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation**: Designed simulation platform achieving 100% test coverage
- **Smart Building**: Developed CAN-based lighting control with 15% energy savings
